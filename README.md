# Still under development!
Algo Visualizer is an application that animates graph algorithms. The code base is in C and it utilizes Raylib library for UI rendering.  
Raylib repo: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib  
Raylib official website: https://www.raylib.com/  

Until I have an official Alpha, I will treat this README as a status update.

## Supported algorithms:
DFS

## Currently working on:
1) Refactoring as main.c is pretty spaghetti
2) Adding Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

## Issues:
1) Dragging a node also primes it for select mode, so after dragging a node, and the user clicks on another node, it automatically creates an edge.

## Additional ideas:
1) Learn shaders to make things look prettier
   - Glow effect to nodes and edges
   - More algorithms!
